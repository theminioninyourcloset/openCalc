# openCalc
openCalc is an Open Source calculator that I am developing in order to start learning the C++ language. I plan on creating a very simple piece of software that'll have a compact and neat GUI and would be able to act as a basic calculator that could do the following:

* Add
* Subtract
* Multiply
* Divide
* Percentages
* Square roots
