# openCalc
openCalc is an open source calculator that I am developing in order to teach myself the C++ language in the process. I plan on creating a very simple piece of software that'll be able to act as a basic calculator that'll be able to do the following:

* Add
* Subtract
* Multiply
* Divide
* Percentages
* Square roots
